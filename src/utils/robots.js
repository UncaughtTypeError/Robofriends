    about: "WALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth. He spends his days tidying up the planet, one piece of garbage at a time. Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend Hal and music playing from his on-board recorder) he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest. He stores and displays these 'treasures' such as a birdcage full of rubber ducks, a Rubik's Cube, Zippos, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden trophy at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds while throwing away things like a diamond ring, and watching a video cassette of Hello, Dolly! via an iPod viewed through a large Fresnel lens."

    about: "The A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000, often simply AWESOM-O, is a large robot the size of a fourth grader manufactured in Japan... actually, it's another of Eric Cartman's aliases, a robot made out of big cardboard boxes, and a blinking red light, with the name written on the chest and a fake speaker. Cartman hoped he could learn all of Butters Stotch's deepest, darkest secret in disguise as the toy robot, but was instead forced to help him administer suppository tablets, give pleasure to an aging movie executive and become a weapon for the Government."

    about: "Marvin the Paranoid Android is a fictional character in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams. Marvin is the ship's robot aboard the starship Heart of Gold. Originally built as one of many failed prototypes of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation's GPP (Genuine People Personalities) technology, Marvin is afflicted with severe depression and boredom, in part because he has a 'brain the size of a planet' which he is seldom, if ever, given the chance to use. Indeed, the true horror of Marvin's existence is that no task he could be given would occupy even the tiniest fraction of his vast intellect. Marvin claims he is 50,000 times more intelligent than a human, (or 30 billion times more intelligent than a live mattress) though this is, if anything, an underestimation."
